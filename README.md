This repo serves as a version control and for my dissertation research, and a great way to inspect my work in progress. The README will also be a makeshift blog where I will post developments to the project. Please feel free to send me an email at bambrose@ucla.edu if you have questions.

This talk provided an introduction to my coding workflow and illustrated some of the data management and research design decisions that face anyone who studies sociocultural networks. Take a look at the [prezi][2-13-15SCWG] for a visual guide to my suite of programming functions. I hope to add to this prezi as a way of explaining the entire workflow of the project.
